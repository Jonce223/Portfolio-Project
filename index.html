                    Hello! My Name is Jonas. I'm 24 years old and started learning programming from scratch again.
                    At the moment I;m in Germany playing basketball professionally and studying full-stack developer courses at 
                    Codecademy so that I can work with programming, cause I love it.

                    This Codecademy project was about using flexbox. It was quite a challange at first, because I had to use my
                    theory knowledge in practice. This project was one of my enjoyments.

                <p>
                    This Codecademy project also needed FlexBox, but this one was also special.
                    It tested you're skills of flexbox and CSS knowledge.
